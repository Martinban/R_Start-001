## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Data science-001 Data frames are awesome
Most functions for inference, modelling, and graphing are happy to be passed a data frame via a data = argument. 
Data frames – can hold variables of different flavors, such as character data (subject ID or name), quantitative data (white blood cell count), and categorical information (treated vs. untreated).
if you use matrices for data analysis, u make the terrible mistake of spreading a dataset out over multiple, unlinked objects, Because you can’t put character data, such as subject name, into the numeric matrix that holds white blood cell count. This fragmentation is a Bad Idea.

#1. Get the data
```{r}
#install.packages("gapminder") #install once in the console



#The tidyverse offers a special case of R’s default data frame: the “tibble”. 
#print tibble is the first big win. But you have to install tidyverse
#install.packages("tidyverse")


library(gapminder) #load it everytime you use it
library(tidyverse)


```

#2. checking data loaded with simple command
```{r}

str(gapminder)
## see? it's still a regular data frame, but also a tibble
class(gapminder)
gapminder
head(gapminder)
tail(gapminder)
as_tibble(iris)
names(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
length(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)
nrow(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)

```
#3. data analysis by ploting
```{r}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, gapminder)
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, gapminder)
plot(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), gapminder)

```

```{r}
#Let’s go back to the result of str() to talk about what a data frame is
#A data frame is a special case of a list, which is used in R to hold just about anything. Data frames are a special case where the length of each list component is the same. Data frames are superior to matrices in R because they can hold vectors of different flavors, e.g. numeric, character, and categorical data can be stored together. This comes up alot!
  
#Look at the variables inside a data frame
#To specify a single variable from a data frame, use the dollar sign $. Let’s explore the numeric variable for life expectancy.
str(gapminder)

head(gapminder$lifeExp)
summary(gapminder$lifeExp)
hist(gapminder$lifeExp)
summary(gapminder$year)
table(gapminder$year)

#The variables for country and continent hold truly categorical information, which is stored as a factor in R
class(gapminder$continent)#check if it the variable is a categorial variable using class()
summary(gapminder$continent)#summary return how many rows or enties of each categorical values
levels(gapminder$continent)
nlevels(gapminder$continent)# calculate how many values of a categorical variable

str(gapminder$continent)#str(a categorical variable) print its nlevels() value and ?

table(gapminder$continent)#?exactly it return?
barplot(table(gapminder$continent))


```
#4 fancy stuff: filtering, subsetting
```{r}
## we exploit the fact that ggplot2 was installed and loaded via the tidyverse
ggplot(filter(gapminder, continent != "Oceania"),
aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) # just initializes
p <- ggplot(filter(gapminder, continent != "Oceania"),
aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p <- p + scale_x_log10() # log the x axis the right way
p + geom_point() # scatterplot
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) # map continent to color
p + geom_point(alpha = (1/3), size = 3) + geom_smooth(lwd = 3, se = FALSE)
p + geom_point(alpha = (1/3), size = 3) + facet_wrap(~ continent) +
geom_smooth(lwd = 1.5, se = FALSE)
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent))
p + geom_point(alpha = (1/3), size = 3) + facet_wrap(~ continent) +
geom_smooth(lwd = 1.5, se = FALSE)


```
#5 Use the tidyverse!!! This will provide a special type of data frame called a “tibble” that has nice default printing behavior, among other benefits.

When in doubt, str() something or print something.

Always understand the basic extent of your data frames: number of rows and columns.

Understand what flavor the variables are.

Use factors!!! But with intention and care.

Do basic statistical and visual sanity checking of each variable.

Refer to variables by name, e.g., gapminder$lifeExp, not by column number. Your code will be more robust and readable.

```{r}
#load the tidyverse, which will load dplyr
#The gapminder data frame is a special kind of data frame: a tibble
gapminder
#For a reminder of the problems with base data frame printing, go type iris in the R Console or, better yet, print a data frame to screen that has lots of columns.

#To turn any data frame into a tibble use as_tibble()

as_tibble(iris)
#print(), that know about tibbles and do something special. There will others that do not, like summary()

print(gapminder)#show raw data
summary(gapminder)#statistical description

(canada <- gapminder[241:252, ])# slice a piece of data frame:create mini datasets for each level of some factor 


```

#6 making dataset
```{r}
canada <- gapminder[241:252, ]

filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 29)

filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))

gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp < 29, ] ## repeat `gapminder`, [i, j] indexing is distracting
subset(gapminder, country == "Rwanda") ## almost same as filter; quite nice actually


```
#7. bad practice
```{r}
#Under no circumstances should you subset your data the way I did at first:

excerpt <- gapminder[241:252, ]

#Why is this a terrible idea?

#It is not self-documenting. What is so special about rows 241 through 252?
#It is fragile. This line of code will produce different results if someone changes the row order of gapminder, e.g. sorts the data earlier in the script.
```

#8 good practice
```{r}
filter(gapminder, country == "Canada")
#This call explains itself and is fairly robust
```

#9 Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows)exploit the new pipe operator that the tidyverse imports from the magrittr package by Stefan Bache
```{r}
gapminder %>% head()
#Never fear, you can still specify other arguments to this function! To see the first 3 rows of Gapminder, we could say head(gapminder, 3) or this:
gapminder %>% head(3)
#You are probably not impressed yet, but the magic will soon happen

```
#Use select() to subset the data on variables or columns
```{r}
select(gapminder, year, lifeExp)
```
```{r}
#Use select() plus head to subset the square data on  columns@rows
gapminder %>%
  select(year, lifeExp) %>%
  head(4)
#Revel in the convenience
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>%
  select(year, lifeExp)
#what a typical base R call would look like
gapminder[gapminder$country == "Cambodia", c("year", "lifeExp")]
# the data is always the very first argument of the verb functions. dplyr’s verbs, such as filter() and select(), are what’s called pure functions

```

#Create a copy of gapminder for mutate
```{r}
#baby's confusion to clear: make a copy of dataset
(my_gap <- gapminder)
#Use mutate(datafram,new varable) to add new variables

my_gap <- my_gap %>%
mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
my_gap
#per capita: by every person
canada <- my_gap %>%
filter(country == "Canada")

#mutate() builds new variables sequentially so you can reference earlier ones (like canada) when defining later ones (like gdpPercapRel). Also, you can get rid of a variable by setting it to NULL

#you don't need my_gap$ before country, because when piping, it first search obj piped in then variable

my_gap <- my_gap %>%
mutate(canada = rep(canada$gdpPercap, nlevels(country)),
gdpPercapRel = gdpPercap / canada,
canada = NULL)

#you need my_gap$country without piping %>% 
rep(canada$gdpPercap, nlevels(my_gap$country))
#similar to the new variable, when calling, you need my_gap$gdpPercapRel
my_gap$gdpPercapRel

summary(my_gap$gdpPercapRel)
```
#Use arrange() to row-order data in a principled way
```{r}

my_gap %>%
  arrange(year, country)

my_gap %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
    arrange(lifeExp)

my_gap %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExp))
#I advise that your analyses NEVER rely on rows or variables being in a specific order.

```
#Use rename() to rename variables
```{r}
my_gap %>%
  rename(life_exp = lifeExp,
         gdp_percap = gdpPercap,
         gdp_percap_rel = gdpPercapRel)

#select() can rename the variables you request to keep.
#select() can be used with everything() to hoist a variable up to the front of the tibble.
my_gap %>%
filter(country == "Burundi", year > 1996) %>%
select(WHEN = year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>% #WHEN renamed year
select(gdpPercap, everything())
#everything() is one of several helpers for variable selection
```

#group_by() is a mighty weapon
dplyr offers powerful tools to solve this class of problem.

group_by() adds extra structure to your dataset – grouping information – which lays the groundwork for computations within the groups.
summarize() takes a dataset with nn observations, computes requested summaries, and returns a dataset with 1 observation.
Window functions take a dataset with nn observations and return a dataset with nn observations.
mutate() and summarize() will honor groups.
You can also do very general computations on your groups with do(), though elsewhere in this course, I advocate for other approaches that I find more intuitive, using the purrr package.
Combined with the verbs you already know, these new tools allow you to solve an extremely diverse set of problems with relative ease.

```{r}
#worth thinking and analyzing
my_gap %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n())

#You could get these same frequencies using table() from base R
table(gapminder$continent)

str(table(gapminder$continent))

#The tally() function is a convenience function that knows to count rows. It honors groups
my_gap %>%
group_by(continent) %>%
tally()

#The count() function is an even more convenient function that does both grouping and counting.
my_gap %>%
count(continent)

#What if we wanted to add the number of unique countries for each continent? You can compute multiple summaries inside summarize(). Use the n_distinct() function to count the number of distinct countries within each continent.
my_gap %>%
group_by(continent) %>%
summarize(n_obs = n(),
n_countries = n_distinct(country))

```

#General summarization: The functions you’ll apply within summarize() include classical statistical summaries, like mean(), median(), var(), sd(), mad(), IQR(), min(), and max(). Remember they are functions that take nn inputs and distill them down into 1 output.

```{r}
my_gap %>%
group_by(continent) %>%
summarize(avg_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

#summarize_each() applies the same summary function(s) to multiple variables. Let’s compute average and median life expectancy and GDP per capita by continent by year … but only for 1952 and 2007.

my_gap %>%
filter(year %in% c(1952, 2007)) %>%
group_by(continent, year) %>%
summarise_each(funs(mean, median), lifeExp, gdpPercap)

#Let’s focus just on Asia. What are the minimum and maximum life expectancies seen by year?

my_gap %>%
filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
group_by(year) %>%
summarize(min_lifeExp = min(lifeExp), max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp))

#Of course it would be much more interesting to see which country contributed these extreme observations. Is the minimum (maximum) always coming from the same country? That’s where window functions come in.
#worth analyzing
my_gap %>%
filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
group_by(year) %>%
filter(min_rank(desc(lifeExp)) < 2 | min_rank(lifeExp) < 2) %>%
arrange(year) %>%
print(n = Inf)

```
